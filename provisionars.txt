# Provisioner type - local-exec, remote-exec, file provisioner
# File provioner only accepts "/tmp" as destination, for other destination location use combination file + remote-exec provisioners.
# 'local-exec' runs on the system where we run terraform commands, 'remote-exec' runs on remote system, and in 'file' provisioner we define source and destination.
# remote and file provisioners need 'connection' to be defined on windows systems "WINRM" and on linux systems "SSH"

# Vendor provisioners - CHEF, PUPPET, HABITAT, SALTSTACK
